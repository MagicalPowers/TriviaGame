    i will create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
    the player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
    the game ends when the time tuns out. the page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
    dont let the player pick more than one answer per question.
    dont forget to include a countdown timer. 

    make a multi-question, multiple choice trivia-stlye game. 
    With a timer that will "close" the trivia test. 
    And a (DONE) button that will do exactly the same function as the timer.
    radio button
