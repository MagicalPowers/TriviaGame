// i will create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
//     the player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
//     the game ends when the time tuns out. the page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
//     dont let the player pick more than one answer per question.
//     dont forget to include a countdown timer. 

//     make a multi-question, multiple choice trivia-stlye game. 
//     With a timer that will "close" the trivia test. 
//     And a (DONE) button that will do exactly the same function as the timer.
//     radio button
//     dynamically code with jQuery

//i know i need some objects containing questions

//this is stolen from w3schools.com
//this is a thing, a function that will alert, after sixty seconds, some sort of message to the user
//eventually this should run a function that "The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly." but i wouldnt bet on that outcome.
function myFunction() {
    setTimeout(function(){ alert("somesort of message to the user"); }, 60000);
  }
